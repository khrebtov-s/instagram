But if what distresses you is something that lies in your own disposition, who is to prevent you from correcting your way of thinking? And likewise, if you are distressed because you are failing to accomplish some particular action which strikes you as sound, why do you not persist in the action rather than yield to the distress? ‘But something too strong for me is blocking my way.’ Then you should not be distressed, because the responsibility for your failure to act does not rest with you.—‘But my life is not worth living if this act is left undone.’—Then depart from life with generous feelings in your heart, dying in the same spirit as one who achieves his purpose, and reconciled, too, to what has stood in his way.”

By virtue of this, an intelligence free from passions is a mighty citadel;* for man has no stronghold more secure to which he can retreat to remain unassailable from that time onward. One who has failed to see this is merely ignorant, but one who has seen it and fails to take refuge there is beyond the aid of fortune.”

That is what you have been told: as to the further point, that he has harmed you, that you have not been told. I see that my little child is ill? I see just that; I do not see that his life is at risk. And so, in this way, always keep to first impressions and add nothing of your own from within, and then nothing bad will befall you. Or rather, add that you are well acquainted with everything that comes to pass in the world.”
